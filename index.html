    <small id="caption">The Pug has been bred to be a companion and a pleasure to his owners. She has an even and stable temperament, great charm, and an outgoing, loving disposition. Pugs live to please their people, so they are generally easy to train. Their feelings are easily hurt, and harsh training methods should never be used.
